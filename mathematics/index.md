# Mathematics

A collection of my mathematical notes and papers.

- [My Masters thesis (partially)](thesis_report_partial.pdf): A fragment of my MSc thesis on the Complexity of Lens spaces: the uploaded version contains my notes on Differential Topology, Discrete Morse Theory, and 0-efficient triangulations.
- [Thesis Presentation](thesis_pres.pdf): Slides from my thesis presentation on obtaining complexity bounds for Lens spaces.
- [A Introduction on Mapping Class Groups (partially)](Mod.pdf): An expository paper on Mapping Class Groups I wrote during some summer research at Ashoka University; it also includes a cleaned proof of the Mapping Class Group of the n-punctured sphere.
- [Tetrads and Einstein Cartan Theory slides ](Tetrads.pdf):A Presentation (for PYL 742 at IITD) on the tetrad formulation of General Relativity and tetrads being a natural formulation on Einstein Cartan Theory.
- [Model Theory Notes (partially)](model-theory-notes.pdf): My notes for MATH 6830 Model Theory at Cornell.
- [An intro to the Mean Curvature Flow in R^2](MTL603_PDE_project.pdf): A short primer on the Mean Curvature Flow in R^2 (for MTL 603 at IITD).
